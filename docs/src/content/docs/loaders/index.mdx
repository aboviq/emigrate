Loader plugins are used to transform any file type into a JavaScript function that will be called when the migration file is executed.

Out of the box, Emigrate supports the following file extensions: `.js`, `.cjs` and `.mjs`. And both CommonJS and ES Modules are supported. See the [Default Loader](/loaders/default/) for more information.

## Using a loader plugin

You can specify a loader plugin via the `--plugin` (or `-p` for short) option:

```bash
npx emigrate up --plugin mysql
```

Or set it up in your configuration file, see [Plugin configuration](/reference/configuration/#plugins) for more information.

:::tip[Did you know?]
You can specify multiple loader plugins at the same time, which is needed when you mix file types in your migrations.
For example, you can use the `mysql` loader for `.sql` files and the `typescript` loader for `.ts` files.
The [default loader](/loaders/default/) will be used for all other file types, and doesn't need to be specified.
