title: Storage Plugin API

import Link from '@components/Link.astro';

When writing a storage plugin, you will need to implement the following interface:

```ts
type EmigrateStorage = {
  initializeStorage(): Promise<Storage>;
};
```

Where `Storage` is the following interface:

```ts
type Storage = {
  /**
   * Acquire a lock on the given migrations.
   *
   * To best support concurrent migrations (e.g. when multiple services are deployed at the same time and want to migrate the same database)
   * the plugin should try to lock all migrations at once (i.e. in a transaction) and ignore migrations that are already locked (or done).
   * The successfully locked migrations should be returned and are the migrations that will be executed.
   *
   * If one of the migrations to lock is in a failed state, the plugin should throw an error to abort the migration attempt.
   *
   * @returns The migrations that were successfully locked.
   */
  lock(migrations: MigrationMetadata[]): Promise<MigrationMetadata[]>;
  /**
   * The unlock method is called after all migrations have been executed or when the process is interrupted (e.g. by a SIGTERM or SIGINT signal).
   *
   * Depending on the plugin implementation, the unlock method is usually a no-op for already succeeded or failed migrations.
   *
   * @param migrations The previously successfully locked migrations that should now be unlocked.
   */
  unlock(migrations: MigrationMetadata[]): Promise<void>;

  /**
   * Remove a migration from the history.
   *
   * This is used to remove a migration from the history which is needed for failed migrations to be re-executed.
   *
   * @param migration The migration that should be removed from the history.
   */
  remove(migration: MigrationMetadata): Promise<void>;
  /**
   * Get the history of previously executed migrations.
   *
   * For failed migrations, the error property should be set.
   * Emigrate will not sort the history entries, so the plugin should return the entries in the order they were executed.
   * The order doesn't affect the execution of migrations, but it does affect the order in which the history is displayed in the CLI.
   * Migrations that have not yet been executed will always be run in alphabetical order.
   *
   * The history has two purposes:
   * 1. To determine which migrations have already been executed.
   * 2. To list the migration history in the CLI.
   */
  getHistory(): AsyncIterable<MigrationHistoryEntry>;
  /**
   * Called when a migration has been successfully executed.
   *
   * @param migration The name of the migration that should be marked as done.
   */
  onSuccess(migration: MigrationMetadataFinished): Promise<void>;
  /**
   * Called when a migration has failed.
   *
   * The passed error will be serialized so it's easily storable it in the history.
   * If the original Error instance is needed it's available as the `error` property on the finished migration.
   *
   * @param migration The name of the migration that should be marked as failed.
   * @param error The error that caused the migration to fail. Serialized for easy storage.
   */
  onError(migration: MigrationMetadataFinished, error: SerializedError): Promise<void>;
  /**
   * Called when the command is finished or aborted (e.g. by a SIGTERM or SIGINT signal).
   *
   * Use this to clean up any resources like database connections or file handles.
   */
  end(): Promise<void>;
};
```
