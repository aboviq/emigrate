import Link from '@components/Link.astro';

These are common TypeScript types for migration files used by <Link href="/plugins/">plugins</Link>.

## `MigrationMetadata`

```ts
type MigrationMetadata = {
  /**
   * The name of the migration file
   *
   * @example 20210901123456000_create_users_table.js
   */
  name: string;
  /**
   * The directory where the migration file is located, relative to the current working directory
   *
   * @example migrations
   */
  directory: string;
  /**
   * The full absolute path to the migration file
   *
   * @example /home/user/project/migrations/20210901123456000_create_users_table.js
   */
  filePath: string;
  /**
   * The relative path to the migration file, relative to the current working directory
   *
   * @example migrations/20210901123456000_create_users_table.js
   */
  relativeFilePath: string;
  /**
   * The current working directory (the same as process.cwd())
   */
  cwd: string;
  /**
   * The extension of the migration file, with a leading period
   *
   * @example .js
   */
  extension: string;
};
```

## `MigrationMetadataFinished`

```ts
type MigrationMetadataFinished = MigrationMetadata & {
  status: 'done' | 'failed' | 'skipped' | 'pending';
  /**
   * The duration of the migration in milliseconds
   */
  duration: number;
  /**
   * The error that occurred during the migration, if `status` is `"failed"`
   */
  error?: Error;
};
```

## `MigrationHistoryEntry`

```ts
type MigrationHistoryEntry = {
  /**
   * The name of the migration.
   * 
   * @example 20210901123456000_create_users_table.js
   */
  name: string;
  /**
   * The date when the migration was executed.
   */
  date: Date;
  /**
   * The status of the migration.
   * 
   * As an entry is only added to the history after the migration has finished, this will always be either `"done"` or `"failed"`.
   */
  status: 'done' | 'failed';
  /**
   * The error that occurred during the migration, if `status` is `"failed"`
   * 
   * This should be a plain object, as it is serialized when passed to the storage plugin's `onError` method.
   */
  error?: Record<string, unknown>;
};
```
