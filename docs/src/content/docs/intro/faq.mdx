## Why no `down` migrations?

> Always forward never backwards.

Many other migration tools support `down` (or undo) migrations, but in all the years we have been
doing migrations we have never needed to rollback a migration in production,
in that case we would just write a new migration to fix the problem.

In our experience the only time `down` migrations are useful is in development,
and in such case you just revert the migration manually and fix the `up` migration.

The benefit of this is that you don't have to worry about writing `down` migrations, and you can focus on writing the `up` migrations.
This way you will only ever have to write `down` migrations when they are really necessary instead of for every migration
(which makes it the exception rather than the rule, which is closer to the truth).

## Can I use Emigrate with my existing database?

Yes, you can use Emigrate with an existing database. See the <Link href="/guides/baseline/">Baseline guide</Link> for more information.
