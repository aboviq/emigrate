:::note
The following guide will be even simpler soon with the release of a initialization command.
But for now, this is the way to go.

### Install the Emigrate CLI

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @emigrate/cli
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @emigrate/cli
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @emigrate/cli
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Pick a storage plugin

Emigrate uses a [storage plugin](/plugins/storage/) to store the migration history.

Install the plugin you want to use, for example:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @emigrate/mysql
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @emigrate/mysql
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @emigrate/mysql
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Create your first migration

Create a new migration file in your project using:

```bash title="Create a new migration file"
npx emigrate new --plugin mysql create users table
```

```txt title="Output"
Emigrate new v0.10.0 /your/project/path

  ✔ migrations/20231215125421364_create_users_table.sql (done) 3ms

  1 created

```

:::note
The `mysql` plugin is used here to generate a migration file with the `.sql` extension.
Otherwise the file would have the `.js` extension by default.
:::

:::tip[Did you know?]
You can avoid typing `--plugin mysql` by configuring Emigrate using an `emigrate.config.js` file.
See [Configuration](/configuration/) for more information.
:::

#### Fill the migration file

Open the migration file in your editor and fill it with your SQL query:

```sql title="migrations/20231215125421364_create_users_table.sql" {2-7}
-- Migration: create users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

:::note
There's no magic about the first line comment as when using Liquibase, it's just a comment and can be erased.
:::

### Show migration status

To show both pending and already applied migrations (or previously failed), use the `list` command:

```bash title="Show all migrations"
npx emigrate list --storage mysql
```

```txt title="Example output"
Emigrate list v0.10.0 /your/project/path

  ✔ migrations/20231211090830577_another_table.sql (done)
  › migrations/20231215125421364_create_users_table.sql (pending)

  1 done | 1 pending (2 total)

```

### Running the migrations

A good way to test your configuration is to run the migrations in dry mode:

```bash title="Show pending migrations"
npx emigrate up --storage mysql --plugin mysql --dry
```

:::note
This will connect to the database using some default values. For ways to configure the connection, see [Configuration](/configuration).
:::

:::caution
Without the `--dry` flag this will run the migration and change your database!
Be sure to configure the connection correctly and use the `--dry` flag to test your configuration.
:::

:::tip[Did you know?]
In the example above the `@emigrate/mysql` plugin is used twice, once for the `--storage` option as a [Storage Plugin](/plugins/storage/)
and once for the `--plugin` option as a [Loader Plugin](/plugins/loaders/) to be able to read `.sql` files.
