description: "List migrations and their status."

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The `list` command is used to list _all_ migrations, i.e. both already run migrations and migrations that haven't been run yet.

Emigrate takes all migration files in the given directory that haven't been run yet and all migrations from the migration history.  
It then sorts the migrations by filename in ascending order and outputs them and their respective status one by one.

## Usage

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npx emigrate list [options]
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm exec emigrate list [options]
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn exec emigrate -- list [options]
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="package.json">
    ```json {3}
    {
      "scripts": {
        "emigrate": "emigrate list [options]"
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Options

### `-h`, `--help`

Show command help and exit

### `-d`, `--directory <path>`

The directory where the migration files are located. The given path should be absolute or relative to the current working directory.

### `-s`, `--storage <name>`

The storage to use for where to read the migration history.

The name can be either a path to a module or a package name. For package names Emigrate will automatically prefix the given name with these prefixes in order:

- `@emigrate/storage-`
- `emigrate-storage-`
- `@emigrate/plugin-storage-`
- `@emigrate/`

And then try to load the module/package with the given name.

For example, if you want to use the `emigrate-storage-somedb` package, you can specify either `emigrate-storage-somedb` or just `somedb` as the name.
In case you have both a `emigrate-storage-somedb` and a `somedb` package installed, the `emigrate-storage-somedb` package will be used.

### `-r`, `--reporter <name>`

The reporter to use for listing the migrations.

The name can be either a path to a module or a package name. For package names Emigrate will automatically prefix the given name with these prefixes in order:

- `@emigrate/reporter-`
- `emigrate-reporter-`
- `@emigrate/`

And then try to load the module/package with the given name.

For example, if you want to use the `emigrate-reporter-somereporter` package, you can specify either `emigrate-reporter-somereporter` or just `somereporter` as the name.
