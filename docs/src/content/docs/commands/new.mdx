import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import Link from '@components/Link.astro';

The `new` command is used to create a new migration file in the given directory.

The migration file can be based on a template, generated by a <Link href="/plugins/generators/">generator plugin</Link>, or just be an empty file.

## Usage

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npx emigrate new [options] <name>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm emigrate new [options] <name>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn emigrate new [options] <name>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
    ```bash
    bunx --bun emigrate new [options] <name>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="deno">
    ```json title="package.json" {3,6}
    {
      "scripts": {
        "emigrate": "emigrate"
      },
      "dependencies": {
        "@emigrate/cli": "*"
      }
    }
    ```

    ```bash
    deno task emigrate new [options] <name>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Arguments

### `<name>`

The name of the migration. The name will be used to generate the migration filename.

The name can be provided as a single argument or as multiple arguments.
If multiple arguments are provided, the arguments will be joined with a space before being passed to the filename generator (the default filename generator replaces all whitespace and non-path safe characters with underscores).

## Options

### `-h`, `--help`

Show command help and exit

### `-d`, `--directory <path>`

The directory where the migration files are located. The given path should be absolute or relative to the current working directory.

### `-t`, `--template <path>`

The template file to use for generating the migration file. The given path should be absolute or relative to the current working directory.

The template can contain a `{{name}}` placeholder which will be replaced with the migration name provided to the command. The generated file will have the same extension as the template file, unless the [`--extension`](#-e---extension-ext) option is used.

### `-e`, `--extension <ext>`

The extension to use for the migration file. Unless the [`--template`](#-t---template-path) option is also specified the file will be empty.

### `-p`, `--plugin <name>`

The <Link href="/plugins/generators">generator plugin</Link> to use. The generator plugin is responsible for generating the migration filename and its contents.

The name can be either a path to a module or a package name. For package names Emigrate will automatically prefix the given name with these prefixes in order:

- `@emigrate/plugin-`
- `emigrate-plugin-`
- `@emigrate/`

And then try to load the module/package with the given name.

For example, if you want to use the `emigrate-plugin-someplugin` package, you can specify either `emigrate-plugin-someplugin` or just `someplugin` as the name.
In case you have both a `emigrate-plugin-someplugin` and a `someplugin` package installed, the `emigrate-plugin-someplugin` package will be used.

### `-r`, `--reporter <name>`

The <Link href="/plugins/reporters/">reporter</Link> to use for listing the migrations.

The name can be either a path to a module or a package name. For package names Emigrate will automatically prefix the given name with these prefixes in order:

- `@emigrate/reporter-`
- `emigrate-reporter-`
- `@emigrate/`

And then try to load the module/package with the given name.

For example, if you want to use the `emigrate-reporter-somereporter` package, you can specify either `emigrate-reporter-somereporter` or just `somereporter` as the name.
