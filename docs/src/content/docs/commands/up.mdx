title: "`emigrate up`"
description: "Run migrations"

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import Link from '@components/Link.astro';

The `up` command is used to either list or run all pending migrations, i.e. migrations that haven't been run yet.

Emigrate takes all migration files in the given directory and compares them to the migration history so that it knows which migrations are pending.  
It then sorts the pending migrations by filename in ascending order and runs them one by one.

If any of the migrations fail, the command will be aborted and the rest of the migrations will not be run.

## Usage

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npx emigrate up [options]
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm emigrate up [options]
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn emigrate up [options]
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
    ```bash
    bunx --bun emigrate up [options]
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="deno">
    ```json title="package.json" {3,6}
    {
      "scripts": {
        "emigrate": "emigrate"
      },
      "dependencies": {
        "@emigrate/cli": "*"
      }
    }
    ```

    ```bash
    deno task emigrate up [options]
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Options

### `-h`, `--help`

Show command help and exit

### `--dry`

List the pending migrations that would be run without actually running them

### `-d`, `--directory <path>`

The directory where the migration files are located. The given path should be absolute or relative to the current working directory.

### `-s`, `--storage <name>`

The <Link href="/plugins/storage/">storage plugin</Link> to use, which is responsible for where to store the migration history.

The name can be either a path to a module or a package name. For package names Emigrate will automatically prefix the given name with these prefixes in order:

- `@emigrate/storage-`
- `emigrate-storage-`
- `@emigrate/plugin-storage-`
- `@emigrate/`

And then try to load the module/package with the given name.

For example, if you want to use the `emigrate-storage-somedb` package, you can specify either `emigrate-storage-somedb` or just `somedb` as the name.
In case you have both a `emigrate-storage-somedb` and a `somedb` package installed, the `emigrate-storage-somedb` package will be used.

### `-p`, `--plugin <name>`

The <Link href="/plugins/loaders/">loader plugin(s)</Link> to use. Can be specified multiple times to use multiple plugins.

- `@emigrate/plugin-`
- `emigrate-plugin-`
- `@emigrate/`

And then try to load the module/package with the given name.

For example, if you want to use the `emigrate-plugin-someplugin` package, you can specify either `emigrate-plugin-someplugin` or just `someplugin` as the name.
In case you have both a `emigrate-plugin-someplugin` and a `someplugin` package installed, the `emigrate-plugin-someplugin` package will be used.

### `-r`, `--reporter <name>`

The <Link href="/plugins/reporters/">reporter</Link> to use for reporting the migration progress.

The name can be either a path to a module or a package name. For package names Emigrate will automatically prefix the given name with these prefixes in order:

- `@emigrate/reporter-`
- `emigrate-reporter-`
- `@emigrate/`

And then try to load the module/package with the given name.
