import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The `remove` command is used to remove a migration from the history. This is useful if you want to retry a migration that has failed.

## Usage

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npx emigrate remove [options] <name>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm emigrate remove [options] <name>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn emigrate remove [options] <name>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="package.json">
    ```json {3}
    {
      "scripts": {
        "emigrate": "emigrate remove [options] <name>"
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Arguments

### `<name>`

The name of the migration file to remove, including the extension, e.g. `20200101000000_some_migration.js`.

## Options

### `-h`, `--help`

Show command help and exit

### `-d`, `--directory <path>`

The directory where the migration files are located. The given path should be absolute or relative to the current working directory.

### `-f`, `--force`

Force removal of the migration history entry even if the migration file does not exist or it's in a non-failed state.

### `-s`, `--storage <name>`

The [storage plugin](../../plugins/storage/) to use, which is responsible for where to store the migration history.

The name can be either a path to a module or a package name. For package names Emigrate will automatically prefix the given name with these prefixes in order:

- `@emigrate/storage-`
- `emigrate-storage-`
- `@emigrate/plugin-storage-`
- `@emigrate/`

And then try to load the module/package with the given name.

For example, if you want to use the `emigrate-storage-somedb` package, you can specify either `emigrate-storage-somedb` or just `somedb` as the name.
In case you have both a `emigrate-storage-somedb` and a `somedb` package installed, the `emigrate-storage-somedb` package will be used.

### `-r`, `--reporter <name>`

The reporter to use for listing the migrations.

The name can be either a path to a module or a package name. For package names Emigrate will automatically prefix the given name with these prefixes in order:

- `@emigrate/reporter-`
- `emigrate-reporter-`
- `@emigrate/`

And then try to load the module/package with the given name.

For example, if you want to use the `emigrate-reporter-somereporter` package, you can specify either `emigrate-reporter-somereporter` or just `somereporter` as the name.
