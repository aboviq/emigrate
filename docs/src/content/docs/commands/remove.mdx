The `remove` command is used to remove a migration from the history. This is useful if you want to retry a migration that has failed.

## Usage

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npx emigrate remove [options] <name/path>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm emigrate remove [options] <name/path>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn emigrate remove [options] <name/path>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
    ```bash
    bunx --bun emigrate remove [options] <name/path>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="deno">
    ```json title="package.json" {3,6}
    {
      "scripts": {
        "emigrate": "emigrate"
      },
      "dependencies": {
        "@emigrate/cli": "*"
      }
    }
    ```

    ```bash
    deno task emigrate remove [options] <name/path>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Arguments

### `<name/path>`

The name of the migration file to remove, including the extension, e.g. `20200101000000_some_migration.js`, or a relative file path to a migration file to remove, e.g: `migrations/20200101000000_some_migration.js`.

Using relative file paths is useful in terminals that support autocomplete, and also when you copy and use the relative migration file path from the output of the <Link href="/commands/list/">`list`</Link> command.

## Options

### `-h`, `--help`

Show command help and exit

### `-d`, `--directory <path>`

The directory where the migration files are located. The given path should be absolute or relative to the current working directory.

### `-f`, `--force`

Force removal of the migration history entry even if the migration file does not exist or it's in a non-failed state.

### `-i`, `--import <module>`

A module to import before remove the migration. This option can be specified multiple times.

Can for instance be used to load environment variables using [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) with `--import dotenv/config`.

### `-s`, `--storage <name>`

The <Link href="/plugins/storage/">storage plugin</Link> to use, which is responsible for where to store the migration history.

The name can be either a path to a module or a package name. For package names Emigrate will automatically prefix the given name with these prefixes in order:

- `@emigrate/storage-`
- `emigrate-storage-`
- `@emigrate/plugin-storage-`
- `@emigrate/`

And then try to load the module/package with the given name.

For example, if you want to use the `emigrate-storage-somedb` package, you can specify either `emigrate-storage-somedb` or just `somedb` as the name.
In case you have both a `emigrate-storage-somedb` and a `somedb` package installed, the `emigrate-storage-somedb` package will be used.

### `-r`, `--reporter <name>`

The <Link href="/plugins/reporters/">reporter</Link> to use for listing the migrations.

The name can be either a path to a module or a package name. For package names Emigrate will automatically prefix the given name with these prefixes in order:

- `@emigrate/reporter-`
- `emigrate-reporter-`
- `@emigrate/`

And then try to load the module/package with the given name.

For example, if you want to use the `emigrate-reporter-somereporter` package, you can specify either `emigrate-reporter-somereporter` or just `somereporter` as the name.

### `--color`, `--no-color`

Force enable/disable colored output, option is passed to the reporter which should respect it.
