Storage plugins are used for storing and reading the migration history state.
Usually you'll want to store the migration history in the same database as the one which your migration files are targeting.

## Using a storage plugin

You can specify a storage plugin via the `--storage` (or `-s` for short) option:

```bash
npx emigrate list --storage mysql
```

Or set it up in your configuration file, see [Storage configuration](/reference/configuration/#storage) for more information.
