A generator plugin is a plugin that generates new migration files.
They are responsible for both generating the new file's name and its contents.

:::tip[Did you know?]
Many of the [Loader Plugins](/plugins/loaders/) usually include a generator plugin as well.
The generator is responsible for generating migration files in a specific format and the loader is responsible for loading the same format.

## Available Generator Plugins

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="JavaScript generator" href="/plugins/generators/js/" description="A generator that generates .js migration files (using ESM and default export)" />
  <LinkCard title="MySQL generator" href="/plugins/generators/mysql/" description="A generator that generates .sql migration files" />
</CardGrid>

:::note
Instead of having to install a generator plugin, you can also use the much simpler [`--template`](/commands/new/#t---template-path) option to specify a custom template file for new migrations.
