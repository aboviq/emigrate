The File System Storage is a storage driver that stores the migration history in a `.json` file on the local file system.

:::caution
This is suitable for simple setups, but for more advanced setups for instance where the application is deployed on multiple servers, you should use a database storage plugin instead.

## Configuration

The File System Storage can be configured easily in your <Link href="/reference/configuration/">`emigrate.config.js` file</Link>:

```js {1,4-6}
import storageFs from '@emigrate/storage-fs';

export default {
  storage: storageFs({
    filename: './migrations.json',
  }),
};
```

### Options

#### `filename`

**type:** `string`

Should be a path either relative to the project root or an absolute path. It doesn't need to have the `.json` extension, but its contents will be in JSON format.
