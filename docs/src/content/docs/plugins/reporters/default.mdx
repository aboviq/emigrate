title: Default Reporter
---

Emigrate's default reporter. The default reporter recognizes if the current terminal is an interactive shell (or if it's a CI environment), if that's the case _no_ animations will be shown.

## Usage

By default, Emigrate uses the default reporter.

## Example output

```bash
