import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import Link from '@components/Link.astro';

:::tip[Using Bun or Deno?]
If you are using [Bun](https://bun.sh) or [Deno](https://deno.land) you are already good to go as they both support TypeScript out of the box!
:::

If you're using NodeJS you have at least the two following options to support running TypeScript migration files in NodeJS.

## Using `tsx`

If you want to be able to write and run migration files written in TypeScript an easy way is to install the [`tsx`](https://github.com/privatenumber/tsx) package.

### Installing `tsx`

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install tsx
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add tsx
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add tsx
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
You must install `tsx` as an ordinary dependency, not as a dev dependency,
in case you are pruning your development dependencies before deploying your application (which you should).
:::

### Loading TypeScript migrations

After installing `tsx` you can load it in two ways.

#### Via CLI

Using the <Link href="/commands/up/#-i---import-module">`--import`</Link> flag you can load `tsx` before running your migration files.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npx emigrate up --import tsx
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm emigrate up --import tsx
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn emigrate up --import tsx
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
This method is necessary if you want to write your configuration file in TypeScript without having `typescript` installed in your production environment, as `tsx` must be loaded before the configuration file is loaded.
:::

#### Via configuration file

You can also directly import `tsx` in your configuration file (will only work if you're not using TypeScript for your configuration file).

```js title="emigrate.config.js" {1}
import 'tsx';

export default {
  // ...
};
```

Then you can run your migration files as usual:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npx emigrate up
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm emigrate up
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn emigrate up
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Building TypeScript migrations

If you don't want to have `tsx` (or similar) as a dependency included in your production environment then
you can build your TypeScript migration files using the [`tsc`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) compiler or
some other tool that are already part of your build process when transpiling your TypeScript code to JavaScript.

Assume that you have all of your migrations in a `src/migrations` directory and you have built them to a `dist/migrations` directory.

Then you can run your migration files by pointing to the `dist/migrations` directory:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npx emigrate up -d dist/migrations
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm emigrate up -d dist/migrations
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn emigrate up -d dist/migrations
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
If you're mixing languages for your migration files, e.g. you have both `.sql` and `.ts` files in `src/migrations`, make sure that they are all copied to the destination directory if not part of the TypeScript build process.
