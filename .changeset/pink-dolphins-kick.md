'@emigrate/postgres': minor

@emigrate/postgres is now able to both generate and load migration files written in JavaScript or TypeScript. The package exports a type that is used in JS and TS migration files generated by its template plugin, and the loader plugin then figures out if a migration file can be loaded by the plugin by looking for "@emigrate/postgres" inside such migration files. A JavaScript or TypeScript migration generated by the template plugin accepts a single function parameter which is the `sql` tagged template literal from a connection pool created by the `postgres` package. @emigrate/postgres automatically handles closing/releasing of the database connections.
