  -l, --limit <count>     Limit the number of migrations to run
  -f, --from <name>       Start running migrations from the given migration name, the given name doesn't need to exist
                          and is compared in lexicographical order
  -t, --to <name>         Skip migrations after the given migration name, the given name doesn't need to exist
                          and is compared in lexicographical order
  --dry                   List the pending migrations that would be run without actually running them

Examples:

  emigrate up --directory src/migrations -s fs
  emigrate up -d ./migrations --storage @emigrate/mysql
  emigrate up -d src/migrations -s postgres -r json --dry
  emigrate up -d ./migrations -s mysql --import dotenv/config
  emigrate up --limit 1
  emigrate up --to 20231122120529381_some_migration_file.js
  emigrate up --to 20231122120529381_some_migration_file.js --no-execution
```

### Examples

Create a new migration:

```bash
npx emigrate new -d migrations create some fancy table
# or
pnpm emigrate new -d migrations create some fancy table
# or
yarn emigrate new -d migrations create some fancy table
# or
bunx --bun emigrate new -d migrations create some fancy table
```

Will create a new empty JavaScript migration file with the name "YYYYMMDDHHmmssuuu_create_some_fancy_table.js" in the `migrations` directory.
