# @emigrate/postgres

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- d49da0c: Generator plugins are no more. Template plugins is the new thing. A generator plugin was responsible both for generating the contents of new migration files and their filenames, a template plugin only generates the contents of new files. A template plugin can provide multiple templates where each template have a corresponding file extension. Multiple template plugins can have templates with the same extension and in a coming change the user will be able to chose which template to use when that's the case. This new type of plugin opens up new potential use cases like automatically generating migration files based on diffing two database schemas for instance. A template plugin can provide templates as either strings, or sync or async functions returning strings.

### Minor Changes

- f70dd70: Specify a description for each migration template and sort them in priority order
- d49da0c: @emigrate/postgres is now able to both generate and load migration files written in JavaScript or TypeScript. The package exports a type that is used in JS and TS migration files generated by its template plugin, and the loader plugin then figures out if a migration file can be loaded by the plugin by looking for "@emigrate/postgres" inside such migration files. A JavaScript or TypeScript migration generated by the template plugin accepts a single function parameter which is the `sql` tagged template literal from a connection pool created by the `postgres` package. @emigrate/postgres automatically handles closing/releasing of the database connections.
